# 🧰 AI Cover Letter Generator - Project Plan

> A beginner-friendly AI agent that generates personalized cover letters based on job descriptions and resumes.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Build an **AI-powered cover letter generator** that:
- Accepts a **job description** (text input)
- Reads a user's **resume/CV** (PDF or text)
- Uses an LLM (like GPT or Llama) to generate a **tailored cover letter**
- Outputs the result as readable text or a downloadable `.docx` file

This project will help you learn how to:
- Use LLMs in real-world applications
- Parse PDFs and generate documents
- Build and optionally deploy an AI agent

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Python | Core logic |
| OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`) or Ollama (Llama 3, etc.) | Generate cover letter |
| pdfplumber | Extract text from PDF resume |
| python-docx | Save output as `.docx` |
| Streamlit (optional) | Create a web UI |
| GitHub / Git | Version control |
| Obsidian | Planning and learning notes |

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

| Test Case | How to Test |
|-----------|-------------|
| Resume parsing works | Try with different PDFs |
| LLM prompt works | Paste sample job description and check output |
| Cover letter saves correctly | Check if `.docx` file is created |
| Web app works locally | Run and interact manually |

---

## 📅 Milestones & Time Estimates

| Task | Estimated Time |
|------|----------------|
| Setup environment | 30 mins |
| Read resume from PDF | 1 hour |
| Get LLM working (OpenAI or Ollama) | 1 hour |
| Generate basic cover letter | 1 hour |
| Save to `.docx` | 30 mins |
| Optional: Create web interface | 2–4 hours |

---

## 🌐 Deployment Options (Optional)

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Local Only | Run in terminal or IDE |
| Streamlit Cloud | Free, easy web deployment |
| Hugging Face Spaces | Great for Ollama/local LLMs |
| GitHub Pages | If using static HTML output |

## 💡 Tips & Notes

- Start small — get the CLI version working first
- Use Obsidian to track what you learned each day
- Keep a "Lessons Learned" section below as you go
- Reuse parts of this plan for future agent projects

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned (Update as You Go)

> Add things you learned during the project here:

- _Day 1_: Learned how to extract text from a PDF using `pdfplumber`
- _Day 2_: Figured out how to prompt GPT effectively for cover letter generation
- _Day 3_: Discovered how to create `.docx` files with `python-docx`

---

## 🚩 Challenges to Watch For

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| PDF formatting issues | Try multiple resume samples |
| LLM not generating relevant content | Improve the prompt |
| Saving `.docx` formatting | Use paragraph styles |
| CAPTCHA or login walls | Avoid scraping; use APIs or manual input |

## 🚀 Next Steps

✅ Copy this note into Obsidian  
✅ Create a folder for your project  
✅ Start building one step at a time  
✅ Come back here when you finish a task and update the status  

Would you like me to now:
1. Generate a `requirements.txt` and starter Python code?
2. Help you set up a [[Git]] repo for this project?
3. Show how to run this locally with OpenAI or Ollama?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
